Jep - Java Embedded Python
===========================

Jep embeds CPython in Java through JNI.

Some benefits of embedding CPython in a JVM:

* Using the native Python interpreter may be much faster than
  alternatives.

* Python is mature, well supported, and well documented.

* Access to high quality Python modules, both native CPython
  extensions and Python-based.

* Compilers and assorted Python tools are as mature as the language.

* Python is an interpreted language, enabling scripting of established
  Java code without requiring recompilation.

* Both Java and Python are cross platform, enabling deployment to 
  different operating systems.


Installation
------------
Simply run ``pip install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation jep`` or download
the source and run ``pip install .``. Building and installing require the JDK,
Python, setuptools, and optionally numpy to be installed beforehand. The 
``--no-cache-dir`` and ``--no-build-isolation`` options are not strictly
required, however those settings enable Jep to make customizations for your
environment such as enabling numpy specific behavior if numpy is installed.

Dependencies
------------
* Python >= 3.10
* Java >= 1.8
* NumPy >= 1.7 (optional)

Notable features
----------------
* Interactive Jep console much like Python's interactive console
* Supports multiple, simultaneous, mostly sandboxed sub-interpreters or shared interpreters
* Numpy support for Java primitive arrays
